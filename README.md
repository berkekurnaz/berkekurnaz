### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- :computer: I'm a full stack software developer from Turkey. I'm currently working at @bundlenews.
- :blush: I love node.js, .net core, mongodb, vue.js and flutter. Sometimes I develop web apps and sometimes develop mobile applications. I believe that a developer should have at least 101 knowledge in all areas. 
- :heart: I love open-source projects. I want to upload more open source projects soon.
